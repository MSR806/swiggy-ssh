# Swiggy MCP `/food` Tool Usage

Generated and verified on 2026-05-16 against `https://mcp.swiggy.com/food`.

This file covers Swiggy Food delivery only. Tool names are unqualified in MCP requests: POST to `/food`, then call tool name `search_restaurants`, not `food.search_restaurants`.

## MCP Assumption

Connection and session setup is out of scope for this skill. Assume the caller already has a working MCP client wired to:

```text
POST https://mcp.swiggy.com/food
```

This skill only documents tool names, arguments, workflows, response shapes, and safety gates.

List tools:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
```

Call a tool:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "search_restaurants",
    "arguments": {
      "addressId": "<addressId>",
      "query": "pizza",
      "offset": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Workflow Tree

1. `get_addresses`
2. Show saved addresses and stop until the user selects one. Never guess or invent `addressId`.
3. `search_restaurants` with `addressId`, `query`, optional `offset`
4. Pick an `OPEN` restaurant and persist `restaurantId` and `restaurantName`
5. Browse with `get_restaurant_menu` or search a dish with `search_menu`
6. For customized items, choose variants/addons from `search_menu`
7. `update_food_cart`
8. `get_food_cart`
9. Optional: `fetch_food_coupons` then `apply_food_coupon` if a COD-compatible valid coupon exists
10. Show full cart, available payment methods, and delivery address
11. Require explicit confirmation
12. `place_food_order`
13. `track_food_order` and/or `get_food_orders`

Important: each food menu item uses either legacy `variants` or `variantsV2`. Use the same format returned by `search_menu`; do not mix both.

Addon flow for customized items:

1. Add item with variants only.
2. Call `get_food_cart`.
3. Read `valid_addons` for the chosen variant.
4. Add only valid addon choices and respect min/max constraints.
5. Call `get_food_cart` again immediately after the addon update so the caller has the real cart state.

## Real Response Examples

### `get_addresses`

Use first for Food delivery. The response contains saved address IDs and display details, but no coordinates. Show the list to the user and ask which address to use before calling restaurant/menu/cart tools.

Do not guess, invent, or hard-code `addressId`.

### `search_restaurants`

Call used:

```json
{
  "addressId": "<addressId>",
  "query": "pizza",
  "offset": 0
}
```

Observed response text excerpt:

```text

Checkout precondition: display items, totals, payment methods, and delivery address before `place_food_order`.

Use only payment methods returned by `get_food_cart`. Do not mention or assume payment methods not present in the response.

## Tools Not Executed And Why

| Tool | Reason |
|---|---|
| `apply_food_coupon` | `fetch_food_coupons` returned zero applicable coupons for the tested restaurant/address. |
| `place_food_order` | Would place a real Food order; no Food order confirmation was requested. |
| `report_error` | Only for reporting failures to Swiggy MCP team; no report was requested. |

## Safety Rules

- Never store or log full phone numbers, full addresses, precise coordinates, or real order IDs unless required and protected.
- `place_food_order` creates a real Food delivery order. Call it only after the user has seen final address, items, bill total, and payment method, then explicitly confirms.
- Only use payment methods returned by `get_food_cart`.
- Do not place Food orders with cart value `₹1000` or more; direct the user to the Swiggy app.
- On successful order placement, show the returned message as-is. Do not rephrase Swiggy-branded success text.
- For cancellation requests, do not call MCP tools. Tell the user exactly: "To cancel your order, please call Swiggy customer care at 080-67466729."
